I developed a full-stack music streaming web application, similar to Spotify, using ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, and Firebase. This project features
secure user authentication with Firebase Authentication, allowing users to create accounts,
upload songs, and stream music. The application boasts a responsive design for seamless use
on both desktop and mobile devices. It employs MongoDB for efficient data management and
Firebase Firestore for real-time updates. The backend, built with NodeJS and Express,
handles API requests and manages user sessions. This project demonstrates my ability to
build complex, scalable web applications from scratch.
